In comparing robot-models.py to my own models.py, the two designs both implement
the basic requirements for users, posts, comments, media, and suppression. However,
they differ in structure and approach. robot-models.py extends Django’s built-in
User model, using a separate UserType model to manage user roles, while my models.py
defines a custom User model from scratch with its own fields. robot-models.py also
includes an Avatar model for user bios and avatar uploads, which my version does
not explicitly support. For media, my design introduces PostMedia and CommentMedia
join tables to allow many-to-many attachments of media to posts and comments, while r
obot-models.py uses simpler file upload fields tied directly to users. Both models handle
post and comment suppression using an is_suppressed boolean and a suppression reason field.
Overall, robot-models.py is more tightly integrated with Django’s authentication and media handling,
while my design offers more flexible linking of media but would require more
development to add authentication and user avatars.
